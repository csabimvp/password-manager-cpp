# Password Manager App


## To Do's:
1) Refactor Account class to replace passowrd string with Password pointer instead.
2) This way we will have access to the Password class encription and decription functionalities.
* Once this is done should we remove the password field and have the encrypted version only at all times? 

Keep the Accounts sorted by their AccountNames.

3) Think about a better encription key solution.
